  I'm a Software developer passionate about contributing to amazing projects.
<br><br>
I've been working for the last two years as a Full Stack Developer, focused on the backend side. While the main technologies that I've been using are PHP and JS. But I'm open to consider using any technology.
I'm currently learning and improving my fullstack JS skills.
<br><br>
I enjoy contributing to my community teaching kids how to program.
